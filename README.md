## Inspiration
The entire world is using video conference apps such as Zoom, Google Hangouts, and Microsoft teams like never before. The last thing you want is a mistake like what [Daniel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V__GbBaIXPU) made to happen to you.

## What it does
In a voice call, we recognize phrases or sentences that indicate that you would like to turn off your camera or microphone. Phrases such as "I'm gonna be right back" or "I'm going to the bathroom" will trigger our app. We send you an SMS message to remind you to turn your camera and mic off. In case you don't, we tun it off for you :)

## How I built it
We used the Voiceflow API to program a google home app, along with Google could platform to host cloud functions and Vonage API to send SMS. 

## Challenges I ran into
Working with cloud functions was foreign to all of the members of our team

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Getting all of the different pieces to work as expected

## What I learned
Developing software applications and products for external devices (google home)

## What's next for Kill Switch
Extend to a variety of platforms (right now this only works on google meets)
Extend to more phrases/NLP
